Once upon a time, there was a young man named Alex who was beyond excited about his movie date with his crush. He had been counting down the days and had everything planned to perfection. He dressed to impress, arrived early to grab the perfect seats, and even brought her favorite snacks. As the previews started and the lights dimmed, Alex felt the anticipation build in his chest.

However, as the previews rolled on, Alex's excitement was overshadowed by an urgent need to use the bathroom. He tried to ignore it, thinking it would go away, but the feeling only grew stronger with each passing moment. He didn't want to ruin the date by leaving the theater, but he knew he wouldn't make it through the entire movie without going.

Just as he was about to excuse himself, he realized that the line for the bathroom was out the door. Alex felt his heart drop as he desperately searched for a solution. He tried to cross his legs and shift in his seat, but it was no use. The warm liquid started to spread down his legs, and Alex felt a wave of embarrassment wash over him.

His crush noticed and asked if he was okay. Alex tried to play it off as a spill, but it was obvious what had happened. He felt his face flush red as he stammered an apology. To his relief, his crush was kind and understanding, and they left the theater together.

As they walked through the lobby, Alex felt like he was in a nightmare. He was sure that everyone was talking about him behind his back and laughing at him. He could feel his face getting red, and he wanted to die of embarrassment. He was so focused on hiding his embarrassment that he didn't even notice that his crush was talking to him and trying to make him feel better.

Finally, they reached the exit, and Alex let out a sigh of relief. But just as they were about to step outside, the automatic doors wouldn't budge. They kept closing and reopening, making a loud whooshing sound each time. Alex felt like the doors were mocking him, amplifying his embarrassment for all to hear. He wanted to crawl into a hole and disappear.

However, his crush didn't seem to notice and continued to chat and laugh as if nothing had happened. Alex was grateful for her kind and understanding demeanor. Eventually, they made it outside, and Alex was grateful to be in the fresh air and away from the prying eyes of the cinema patrons.
